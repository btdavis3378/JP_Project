Object-Oriented Programming Project

ORACLE Academy project description
"Scenario - OraclProduction
OraclProduction Ltd are specialists in producing production line manufacturing plants.
They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple packaging
system to a variety of electronic devices.
Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which include music
and movie players. They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all
future production line items. For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete
class for music and movie players.
Your task is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line. This structure would
then allow easy modification to handle different products."

This project was made for an object-oriented programming course. Steps 1-20 are completed.
